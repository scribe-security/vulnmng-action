| ghcr.io/scribe-security/valint:latest | ghcr.io/scribe-security/valint:latest | [CVE-2026-22184](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22184) | zlib | 1.3.1-r51 | Critical | status:new | N/A |  | zlib versions up to and including 1.3.1.2 contain a global buffer overflow in the untgz utility. The TGZfname() function copies an attacker-supplied archive name from argv[] into a fixed-size 1024-byte static global buffer using an unbounded strcpy() call without length validation. Supplying an archive name longer than 1024 bytes results in an out-of-bounds write that can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, and potentially code execution depending on compiler, build flags, architecture, and memory layout. The overflow occurs prior to any archive parsing or validation. | **🔴 1 Exploit(s) Available**: [seclists.org](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2026/Jan/3) \| [View CISA Vulnrichment Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/develop/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22184.json) |

The secret information is stored in memory, where the attacker can trigger the victim program to execute by sending characters to its standard input (stdin). As this occurs, the attacker can train the branch predictor to execute an ROP chain speculatively. This flaw could result in leaked passwords, such as those found in /etc/shadow while performing authentications. | **CVSS 4.7 (MEDIUM)**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` (No user interaction) \| [View CISA Vulnrichment Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/develop/2024/10xxx/CVE-2024-10041.json) |
